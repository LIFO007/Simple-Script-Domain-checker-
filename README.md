# Simple-Script-Domain-checker-
I created a basic shell script that checks if a website is available by providing its name and testing different domain extensions (type your name website on the name ). For example, if we input a name like 'wikipedia', the script will check domains such as wikipedia.com, wikipedia.net, wikipedia.org, etc and return it on the registered_domains.txt file path .
